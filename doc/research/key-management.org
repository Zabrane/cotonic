** Questions

*** Where to store keys and attributes.

- sessionStorage, per tab/site storage. When the tab closes, the data is gone.
- localStorage, per site storage. Data is shared between tabs, and stored on the computer.
- indexDB, indexed storage of items, queryable. (but partial support in IE11)


*** What parts of indexDB is not supported by IE11?

There is a shim. https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim

*** What happens with the sessionStorage?

- Is it deleted? Was it stored on disk or just memory.


*** How fast is key generation?

*** Short lived? 

*** Regenerate often? 

*** How to authenticate server keys?

*** Key Continuity Management

This is SSH's model.

Under normal operation SSH alerts the *first* time that a new service is
contacted. After that first contact, however, SSH is silent unless
the serverâ€™s key changes.
